                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Try it! -- A common question is "will this work", or "what will happen in this case". The only reasonable answer is "try it and see!" Your system will not blow up if you program incorrectly, and it is <i>essential</i> to learn to harness trial and error as one of the most effective ways to learn programming.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Know your sources, and use them! -- The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/"> Python (3.9.6) documentation</a> is invaluable to find utility methods to use. The syntax of Python is documented well in your ZyBook, and in online tutorials. Learn to use your sources productively to help to make progress.

                    Be proud of your code! -- Properly indent it, simplify it where you can to make it more understandable, and comment it where appropriate. You're taking part in an art that most often is shared, and it matters if others can understand your code!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Planning is the best debugging! -- You should never jump into code before thinking about it thoroughly. Design your programs by breaking them into independently implementable chunks, and write + debug them one by one.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Practice methodical debugging! -- Spend time "stepping though" your program, statement by statement to understand the logic behind it, and why it is ending up in a buggy state. Do _not_ take a program that doesn't work, and modify smaller parts of it until it works. Understand why it doesn't work, and use that knowledge to change or even rewrite your program!

                  You can work on Homework assignments in <b>teams of 2</b> if and only if you satisfy the following conditions:
                  <ol>
                    <li>You submit code with a comment block at the top indicating which two students worked on the assignment.</li>

                  <br><br>
                  You can work on the final project on <b>teams of a maximum of 3</b>, and you must follow the same conditions as for the homework assignments.

                  <b>Prep Activities</b>: Prep activities are readings and exercies that must be completed in ZyBooks BEFORE the designated Lectures. These will be graded in the following way:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Completeness  [80%]: You get 80/100 simply by completing the activity before the designated time.</li>
                    <li>Correctness   [20%]: The score you obtain in the activity (%) will constitute the remaining 20% of the prep acctivity grade.</li>

                  If you will not be able to attend (any) lectures and/or labs, you need to register as a fully-asynchronous student with the instructor (send me a detailed explanation using a private message on Piazza). If you miss few synchronous lectures (one or two) then you don't need to do this.

                  <li>You might be asked to complete oral interviews where you explain concepts or code, or do live coding. </li>
