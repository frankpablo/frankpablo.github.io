                  The students should expect to take weekly quizzes that will emphasize basic facts and foundational skills while also serving as assessments of material presented in the previous week’s class. Quizzes are closed-book and closed-notes, and will be administered via Moodle. Quizzes are not to be discussed with other students. Quizzes will be posted on Saturday and will be due before a class on Tuesday. Quizzes are expected to be a recap of what students learn from the course material presented in the previous week’s class and they allow for the instructor to ensure the student is able to grasp the previous week’s material.

                  As a culminating activity in this class, students will work in groups to research a topic of current interest relating to the world of computing in general. You will present the results of your research as a 4-6 page paper (1000-1500 words) and as an oral presentation to the class. All research topics must be approved in advance (typically in the third week of the course) so start brainstorming topics early.

                    It is OK to make mistakes! -- an error is one learned lesson. After trying something, having that fail is as much a datapoint as a correct path. <br>
                    Note that we usually want correct paths after exploring and making a lot of errors so <i>keep looking!</i>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ask for help when stuck! -- if you have 1) tried multiple paths and 2) you have explored the problem and made many mistakes, and you are still stuck, please seek assistance! that's what were here for! 
                    <br>
                    Believe it or not, we actually like teaching and helping you make progress.

                  <li>
                    Know your sources, and use them! -- We'll use web sources only. Be careful with online materials (like tutorials or articles): <i>they are not necessarily correct!</i>, so make sure they are from a reputable source and/or have been peer reviewed. 
                    Learn to use your sources productively to help to make progress.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be proud of your submissions! -- Clarity above all. Use proper styling, and simplify your answers where you can to make it more understandable.

                  <li>
                    Planning is the best problem-solving tool! -- You should not jump into writing solutions or writing code before thinking about it thoroughly. Design your solutions by breaking them into logical parts that make sense independently and when put together to make an argument.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Practice methodical analysis! -- Spend time "stepping though" your work, statement by statement to understand the logic behind it, and why it is logically sound (or why it was marked as incorrect). Do <b>not</b> submit a solution that you don't fully understand with the hope of flying under the radar. We look deeply at your submissions to gauge your level of understanding.
