       <b><big>Abstraction</big></b> is what allow us to have conversations without specifying absurd levels of detail. 
       <br>
       Think about how you order a Pizza: 
      </p>

      <div class="container m-5">

        <p>
          <b>Example 1</b>: Think about how you order a Pizza: 
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Call the pizza place</li>
          <li>Ask for a menu Item (pepperoni pizza)</li>
          <li>Give address and pay information</li>
          <li>Hang up</li>
        </ol>

      </div>

      <p>
        This is a very <b>high-level of abstraction</b> in which the context is clear to both parties and you both already know what every key word means. 
        <br><br>

        It is high-level because the <b>details are not needed, only the context</b>.
        
        <br><br>

        <span style='color:#06a015'><b><big>Activity 1</big></b></span> [1 minute]: If you were teaching an alien (that has never even heard of what a pizza is) to make a pepperoni pizza from scratch, What would you say?

            </ol>
            <br>

              This is a very <b>low-level of abstraction</b> in which <b>the context is not used (much) and great detail is needed</b> to make progress.

      <h3>Ways to learn: The Black-Box approach</h3>

      <p>
        Using a module as a black box is like saying: 
        <br><br>

        <i>"I don't care how it works, I only need to know what I need to give it and what it gives me in return."</i> 
      
        <img class="img-max" src="../figures/lecture02/blackBoxModel.png" >
        <br><br>
         
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will use the computer in this way;
          </li>
          <li>
            We will also learn Python in this way: We will show working examples and explain what the structure does but we will not delve into the <b>how</b> it does it (that is at a future course). 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>

        Once the "High-Level" is understood, we can look inside the box to see more details.
        <br><br>

        This is called a "top-down" approach.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <h3>Ways to learn: The trees-to-forest approach</h3>

      <p>
        Another way we'll learn will be to look at lots of patterns and examples and then to "generalize" what we see to try to find a "rule" that encompasses the examples.
        <br><br>

        We can call this approach: "the bottom-up approach".
      </p>

      

      <p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>

      <h2>
        Is this a language course?
      </h2>

      <p>
        We'll make a rough analogy with learning a foreign language: CS111 is the equivalent of a beginner language course.
        <br><br>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="../figures/lecture02/beginnerLang.png">
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It might not be enough to write a great Spanish-language novel, but it is enough to be able to go on a trip to a country that speaks Spanish and do OK.
          </li>
          <li>
            You might even be able to read a bit of French, Italian, Portuguese, ... any Romance-Language.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>

        <b>In terms of Programming languages</b>, this means that you'll be able to get practical things done and understand other programs written in Python; you will also be able to read and understand a whole lot of <i>similar</i> languages like C, C++, Java, etc.
      </p>


      However, there is a big difference between languages like English or Spanish and programming languages!
      <b>why do you think that is?</b>
      <br><br>

      Now, a quick <b>high-level</b> look at the inside of the black box.

      <br><br>

      <p>
        The modern term <i>Computer</i> refers to a mechanism that "performs calculations" <i>automatically</i> and that can be <i>programmed</i>.
        <br>
        Let's look at these terms one by one:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Automatic</b>: refers to action independent of (human) intervention in order to perform its <a href="https://youtu.be/OpLU__bhu2w?t=612">calculations</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Programmable</b>: a system whose starting conditions and rules of execution can be predefined and assigned prior to execution.
          </li>
        </ul>
<!-- 
        A bit of history:

        <ul>
          <li>
            The <i>Difference Engine</i>, built by Charles Babbage in 1819 was a programmable calculator. It was "automatic" in that it could perform the calculations without intervention as long as someone provided power (hand-cranked).
          </li>
          <li>
            Babbage theorized a <i>more general</i> machine that could be <i>programmable</i> and could do many more things. This was called the <i>Analytical Engine</i> (which has not yet been built as described by Babbage).
          </li>
          <li>
            Ada Lovelace, who worked with Babbage, published the first computer algorithm and is commonly referred to as the <i>first computer programmer</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analog mechanical computers (late 1800's) were built to solve equations to predict all sorts of things
          </li>
          <li>
            Electromechanical calculators (early 1900's).
          </li>
          <li>
            Z3 (1941) first electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Several electromechanical computers built during WW2 to crack codes. Colossus (1943) was the first electronic digital programmable computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            After WW2, we see an explosion in computing speed, memory capacity, and programming complexity.
            <br>
            An important component is the "transistor" (more on this later) was invented in 1947. 
            <br>
            It allowed the construction of smaller, faster, and more efficient computers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Moore's law</b> postulated that the number of transistors that can be packed into a given unit of space will double about every two years.

            The electronic stored program (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby">Manchester Baby</a>) became a "thing".

            <br>
            It allowed the construction of smaller, faster, and more efficient computers: <b>Moore's law</b> postulated that the number of transistors that can be packed into a given unit of space will double about every two years.

      <h3>What are the parts of a Computer?</h3>
      <br><br>
      <img class="img-max" src="../figures/lecture02/computerParts.png">
      <br><br>
      <b>Parts:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>a modern computer has a processor (brain), also know as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">Central Processing Unit</a> (CPU);</li>
        <li>a long term storage location (disk);</li>
        <li>and a couple faster short term storage locations (memory and cache)</li>
        <li>It also has "peripherals" for input (keyboard, mouse), and output (monitor, speakers) </li>
      </ul>
       <br><br>
       
       <b>Operation:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The disk has sectors were data is remains stored even when powering down the computer.</li>
        <li>The memory and the cache are volatile memory; they are faster but the data is lost when powered down.
          <br>
          The cache is faster but smaller than the main memory.</li>
        <li>
          The processor follows programs to cause all its parts to function according to some plan:
          <ol>
            <li>It can try to read information from its cache;</li>
            <li>If it does not find the data there, it looks in main memory;</li>
            <li>If it does not find it there, it reads data from disk into memory and searches memory again;</li>
          </ol>          
        </li>
        <li>
          The processor also reads data from peripherals (like the keyboard) and can write to them (like a monitor)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      <h4>CPU vs GPU</h4>
      <p>
        There are different types of processors; 
        <br><br>

        The <b>CPU</b> is versatile (can run many different operations) at a relatively fast rate.
        <br><br>

        <ul>
          <li>A CPU can interpret instructions and send signals to other parts.</li>
          <li>It can read (or write) data from (to) memory</li>
          <li>It can store small quantities of information that it can access incredibly fast</li>
          <li>It can solve arithmetic or logical problems using its <b>Arithmetic-Logic-Unit</b> (ALU)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><br>
        A <b>GPU</b> (a Graphics Processing Unit) is a massively simplified CPU that can run <i>many</i> simple operations at the same time (in parallel). This makes it very fast.
        <br><br>
        CPUs are good for running general tasks in a computer.
        <br>
        GPUs are good for running simple operations to solve similar problems like for graphics.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>
        Let's look at the <b>logic</b> used by a modern computer to function; 
        <br><br>

        this time from a Low-level to High-level of abstraction. 
        <br><br>

      <h3>From gears to 0's and 1's, and up to a High-Level Language</h3>


      How do we compute something automatically?
        <br>
        We could use <b>Gears & levers</b> but as we discussed, that is problematic (slow and inaccurate).
        <br><br>

        It turns out that using a fast flowing current is a pretty good approach!
        <ul>
          <li>It is energy-efficient</li>
          <li>It is easy to move around</li>
          <li>It is versatile and hard to "damage"</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- water computer -->
        <p>
          A computer works like a <a href="https://youtu.be/IxXaizglscw?t=846">water-pipe system with a gazillion valves</a>. The water (electricity) courses through the system and activates sprinklers, flotation devices, etc, depending on how the valves are set.
          <br><br>
          <img class="img-max" src="../figures/lecture02/waterAdder.png" alt="" style="width:30%">
        </p> 


        <br><br>

        However, <b>How do we "store information" using some sort of flowing current?</b>
        <br><br>

        <span style='color:#06a015'><b><big>Activity 4</big></b></span> [2 minute]: How do we store information in a "computer" that uses flowing current to function?

        <div class="container m-5">
          <span style='color:#000000'>One possible answer</span>: 
          <details>
            <summary>(Wait; then Click)<br><br></summary>
            <p>
              The minimum thing we can know about a thing is: <b>Is it there or not?</b>.
              <br><br>
              To represent this with a flowing current, we can say: 
              <ul>
                <li>If it is flowing in this section (pipe): then <b>YES</b> or <b>TRUE</b></li>
                <li>If it is NOT flowing in this section (pipe): then <b>NO</b> or <b>FALSE</b></li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>
              Anything that has two parts or two sides is called <b>binary</b>, so this piece of information is called a binary datum (a single piece of data), which could be <i>represented</i> with any two symbols:
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>No/Yes</li>
                <li>False/True</li>
                <li>OFF/ON</li>
                <li>\( \bullet\) / \(\boldsymbol{-}\)</li>
                <li>0/1</li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>

              The term <b>bit</b> is derived from <b>binary digit</b>, a logical state (relation between a proposition and the truth) with one of two values.
              <br><br>  

              It is common to represent these with \( 0 \) and \( 1 \), but as you can see below, we can use another approach (OFF/ON) with the same results.
              <br><br>
            </p>

          </details>
        </div>

<!--       <p>
        In this example, the water represents electric current, and the valves represent the electrical switches (transistors) that determine if we have running current <b>(1)</b> or not <b>(0)</b>.
      </p> -->
      <br><br>


      <!-- programmable computer! -->
<!--       <h4>It must be Programmable!</h4>

      <p>
        A computer's true power comes from the fact that it can be <b>programmed</b>. 
        <br>
        Automatically calculating something is <a href="https://youtu.be/OpLU__bhu2w?t=265"><i>OK</i></a> but the programming is the cool bit (no pun intended).
        <br><br>



        <br>
        The "valves" that allow the passage of electricity can be set at some desired starting position and change according to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            rules we indicate (ways in which the valves change at each step)
          </li>
          <li>
            intermediate results (during "calculation"). It should be possible for the valves to be automatically <b>reset</b>!
            <br><br>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="../figures/lecture02/waterTransistor.png" alt="" style="width:88%">
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p> -->

      <p>
        <b>IF</b> we can assign a set of steps to be followed by our system, which will run automatically when executed, we've got a computer!
        <br><br>

        <!-- <div class="mx-lg-3">
          <span style='color:#888888'>
            In the water example, we would need the machine to "read" an initial valve setup and then change the valve positions according to our instructions. 
            <br>
            While this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer#Limitations">possible</a> with water, we'll look at how it is done using electricity.

      <!-- <h4>The Transistor!</h4>

      <p>
        A transistor is an electronics component that lets electricity pass through from one of its input pins (collector) to one of its output pins (emitter) if there is an input on the third <i>signal</i> pin (base). 
        <br><br>
        <img class="img-max" src="../figures/lecture02/transistor.png">
        <br><br>

      <h2>The Transistor</h2>
      <p>
        A transistor is an electronics component that lets electricity pass through from one of its input pins (collector) to one of its output pins (emitter) if there is an input on the third <i>signal</i> pin (base).

        The brilliance here is that <i>this allows an electric signal (that can be programmed) to control another electric signal</i>; making the electric component capable of self-guidance.
<!-- 
        To explain how we do this, we'll use an analogy with water and pipes, which contains: 
        <ul>
          <li>a water reservoir</li>
          <li>valves</li>
          <li>water circuits</li>

        <img id="image" class="img-responsive" src="../figures/lecture02/waterTransistor2.png" alt="" style="width:60%">
        <br><br>

        If you look at the water system, depending on what the "water circuit 2" does, 
        <ul>
          <li>the water could come out of the <span style='color:#ff0000'>red</span> path and close the vale;</li>
          <li>or it could come through the <span style='color:#0000ff'>blue</span> path and open the vale.</li>
        </ul> -->

        <br><br>

        The transistor works like that:
        <ul>
          <li>if there is no <b>signal</b> into the <i>base</i>, then current does not flow from <i>collector</i>  to <i>emitter</i>;</li>
          <li>if there IS a <b>signal</b> into the <i>base</i>, then current flows from the <i>collector</i> into the <i>emitter</i> (and one can use that current to do other things);</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        Check an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f3l8KaVcBg">animation</a> that explains how a transistor works by using the water analogy.
        <br><br>

        These components can be arranged together together with other valve-like components to make more and more complex modules that can be integrated into a full computer.

      <h4>A Program</h4>
      <p>
        A (modern computer) program, in its most basic form, is a list of control signals that tell the computer when to let electricity pass and where to.
        <br><br>
        The lowest form of these control signals therefore depend on two symbols:
        <ul>
          <li>0: no current</li>
          <li>1: current</li>
        </ul>

        A list of control signals written in 0a and 1s is called <b>Machine Code</b>.

        <br><br>

        Since we can write numbers using only 0's and 1's, these can be called binary (from "two") digits (symbols representing numbers), or <b>bits</b>.

          the number is constructed by indicating "how many times we need each power of 16" (that's why base 16) using only the valid symbols.

          \[ 6C1 = 6*16^2 + C*16^1 + 1*16^0 = 6*16^2 + (12)*16^1 + 1*16^0 = 1536 + 192 + 1 = 1729\]

          <br><br>

          <b>Notation</b>: To indicate that we're writing a hex number, we usually <i>prepend</i> "0x" to the number, so the hex number:
        <br>
        1234 should be written <b>0x1234</b> to distinguish it from "one thousand, two hundred and thirty four".

            Translate this number to hex: 3735928559
            <br>
            hint: try dividing by the maximum power of 16 you can fit. Then continue with the remainder.
