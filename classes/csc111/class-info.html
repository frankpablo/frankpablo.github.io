                    Try it! -- A common question is "will this work", or "what will happen in this case". The only reasonable answer is "try it and see!" Your system will not blow up if you program incorrectly, and it is <i>essential</i> to learn to harness trial and error as one of the most effective ways to learn programming.

                    Know your sources, and use them! -- The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/"> Python (3.9.6) documentation</a> is invaluable to find utility methods to use. The syntax of Python is documented well in your ZyBook, and in online tutorials. Learn to use your sources productively to help to make progress.

                  <li>
                    Be proud of your code! -- Properly indent it, simplify it where you can to make it more understandable, and comment it where appropriate. You're taking part in an art that most often is shared, and it matters if others can understand your code!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Planning is the best debugging! -- You should never jump into code before thinking about it thoroughly. Design your programs by breaking them into independently implementable chunks, and write + debug them one by one.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Practice methodical debugging! -- Spend time "stepping though" your program, statement by statement to understand the logic behind it, and why it is ending up in a buggy state. Do _not_ take a program that doesn't work, and modify smaller parts of it until it works. Understand why it doesn't work, and use that knowledge to change or even rewrite your program!

                  <ul>
                    <li>Completeness  [80%]: You get 80/100 simply by completing the activity before the designated time.</li>
                    <li>Correctness   [20%]: The score you obtain in the activity (%) will constitute the remaining 20% of the prep activity grade.</li>

If you need special accommodation, like extended exam time, please submit requests for accommodations in writing with proof of College support from the Office of Disabilities Service within the first two weeks of class. Let me know if you need help with this process.

                <p>
                  COVID-19 has caused several changes to how we run the class.

                <p class="px-5">
                  In lieu of attendance, we will be keeping track of in-class and in-lab (synchronous) participation <b>or</b> your participation using asynchronous methods (Piazza, Office-Hours, Codio exercises).

                  During COVID-19, some students might not be able to attend synchronously because of their timezone or their available technology.

                <p class="px-5">
                  If you will not be able to attend (any) lectures and/or labs, you need to register as a fully-asynchronous student with the instructor (send me a detailed explanation using a private message on Piazza). If you miss few synchronous lectures (one or two) then you don't need to do this.

                  We will offer asynchronous options that need to be completed in a timely manner. 
                  For these students, we will have a different way of counting participation:

                <ul class="px-5">
                  <li>You will be asked to participate in asynchronous team discussions using Piazza.</li>
                  <li>If asked to, you will be required to attend office hours.</li>
                  <li>You might be asked to complete oral interviews where you explain concepts or code, or do live coding. </li>
                  <li>You might be asked to submit video recordings where you explain a concept, explain your code, or present a diagram. </li>
