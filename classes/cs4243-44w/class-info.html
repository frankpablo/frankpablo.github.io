                    Attend all classes synchronously. If you cannot, we will have an asynchronous option but you should let us know beforehand and justify your absence (we will try to be flexible given the pandemic).

                    Complete the work for your module or role in each team. While your teammates might pull for you on a slow week, you are expected to pull your weight over the duration of the project. On the other hand, you should strive to make sure your teammates get a chance to put their own vision and work. The key word is <i>balance</i>.

                <p class="px-4">
                  Throughout the class, students should focus on adhering to the following general tenets: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Don't fear to push</b>: You have accumulated a great deal of knowledge and skills. Put them to the test and use this course as an opportunity to find an application for them. In doing so, you will most likely refine and expand on what you've learned and acquire valuable skills for your next steps.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Be organized</b>: We will help you stay on track and balance your work, but you must do your part to keep the balance and pacing in order to do your bit. This includes giving us feedback (including criticism) as soon as you need it so we can help you and your team (including getting stuck, team dynamics, making a pivot, etc).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Embrace the breadth</b>: You will most likely work on subjects that you are interested in,  but you will also be asked to delve into modules that might seem boring or uninteresting but that are crucial for finishing your full project. This is common in industry and academia; you are in a good spot to learn to deal with those situations. In addition, you will be asked to develop your presentation and reasoning skills during individual and team presentations and demos.

                <h4>Grading with Teams</h4>
                <p>
                  Except for a few individual homework submissions, most of the work is in teams. Every one of the team grades will have an individual component (50%) and a team component (50%). 
                </p>

                <h4>Late or Missed Submissions</h4>
                <p class="px-5">
                  We will try to be as lenient as possible. That said, the schedule has already been relaxed to account for the current difficulties. Team assignments (most of them) suffer heavily if there are missed modules or incomplete work, which is why we will also keep track team health. If your team suffers from continued coordination or balance issues, we might have to make changes (to grades, or in extreme cases, team composition).
                  <br>
                  <b>Late policy</b>: Late assignments will lose 20% per 24-hour period (not pro-rated).
                  Submission of all writing assignments must follow the submission rules indicated in the <a href="./logistics.html">logistics</a> page. All reports, presentations and such will be submitted via your Google Drive (your project shared folder) project website, and eventually uploaded to your project website. You must submit both a document and a PDF (which we will use for grading).
                  Presentations and demos cannot be submitted late for credit as they are required in-class.
                  The submission time will be determined by the upload time of the pdf on Google Drive.
                  Please remember that many deadlines for this class are known far in advance, so plan ahead and work early to anticipate any issues.
                </p>

                
                <h4>Participation instead of Attendance</h4>
                <p class="px-5">
                  In lieu of attendance, we will be keeping track of in-class and in-meeting (synchronous) participation <b>or</b> your participation using asynchronous methods (Piazza, Office-Hours). Answering or asking questions in class, mentor meetings, or in Piazza will help you get full participation points. 
                </p>

                <h4>Synchronous vs Asynchronous Materials</h4>
                <p class="px-5">
                  During COVID-19, some students might not, on occasion, be able to attend synchronously because of their timezone or their available technology. 
                </p>
                <p class="px-5">
                  If you will not be able to attend (any) lectures and/or meetings, you need to register as a fully-asynchronous student with the instructor (send me a detailed explanation using a private message on Piazza). If you miss few synchronous lectures (one or two) then you don't need to do this. You are required to email your instructors before the session you will miss or immediately after the session time.  
                </p>
                <p class="px-5">                  
                  We will offer asynchronous options that need to be completed in a timely manner. 
                  For fully-asynchronous students, or students that miss synchronous submission events, we will have a different ways of counting participation:
                </p>
                <ul class="px-5">
                  <li>You will be asked to participate in asynchronous team discussions using Piazza.</li>
                  <li>If asked to, you will be required to attend office hours.</li>
                  <li>You might be asked to submit video recordings where you explain a concept, explain your code, or present a diagram. </li>
                </ul>

                  Senior Design requires creativity, innovation, and fairness. In order to achieve this, you will receive plenty of help from your classmates, your SD mentors, and Faculty mentors. You will be responsible to do your part and to contribute with original work. 
                  We will keep close attention to the balance of work in teams and we will use demo interviews to make sure you've completed your own work. While the use of third party work is allowed, it is by no means supposed to be the whole of your work and it should always be used with permission and/or avoid infringing upon any licensing restrictions.
