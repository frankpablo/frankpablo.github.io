                  <li>
                    Labs will help you jump into more significant programming projects. You will program during lab, and be responsible for deliverables.

                    Students are assessed through a combination of individual and group homework, online exercises, lab assignments, and exams. Attendance of both labs and lectures is mandatory (attendance during COVID-19 will be evaluated a bit differently, see <i>Grading</i>).

                  Throughout the class, students should focus on adhering to the following general tenets: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Try it! -- A common question is "will this work", or "what will happen in this case". The only reasonable answer is "try it and see!" Your system will not blow up if you program incorrectly, and it is _essential_ to learn to harness trial and error as one of the most effective ways to learn programming.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Know your sources, and use them! -- The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/overview-summary.html"> Javadocs webpage</a> is invaluable to find utility methods to use. The syntax of Java is documented well in your textbook, and in online tutorials. Learn to use your sources productively to help to make progress.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be proud of your code! -- Properly indent it, simplify it where you can to make it more understandable, and comment it where appropriate. You're taking part in an art that most often is shared, and it matters if others can understand your code!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Planning is the best debugging! -- You should never jump into code before thinking about it thoroughly. Design your programs by breaking them into independently implementable chunks, and write + debug them one by one.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Practice methodical debugging! -- Spend time "stepping though" your program, statement by statement to understand the logic behind it, and why it is ending up in a buggy state. Do _not_ take a program that doesn't work, and modify smaller parts of it until it works. Understand why it doesn't work, and use that knowledge to change or even rewrite your program!

                  For this semester only, we will give partial credit for small HW assignments and projects (not for prep readings and exercises). The partial credit will be:

                  <li>One day late: -20%</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                  Submitting 1 second late is the same as a full day late. Plan ahead and submit early.

                  <b>Prep Activities</b>: Prep activities are readings and exercies that must be completed in Codio BEFORE the Lectures or Labs. THese will be graded in the following way:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Reading Only: 100 IF completed the reading oon time; 0 otherwise.</li>
                    <li>Reading And Exercises: 30% is the exercise grade and 70% is for simply complleting the reading; 0 otherwise.</li>
                    <li>Once the deadline arrives, these will be Read-Only with no extensions.</li>

                <p>
                  COVID-19 has caused several changes to how we run the class.

                <p class="px-5">
                  In lieu of attendance, we will be keeping track of in-class and in-lab (synchronous) participation <b>or</b> your participation using asynchronous methods (Piazza, Office-Hours, Codio exercises).

                <p class="px-5">
                  During COVID-19, some students might not be able to attend synchronously because of their timezone or their available technology. 
                </p>
                <p class="px-5">
                  If you will not be able to attend (any) lectures and/or labs, you need to register as a fully-asynchronous student with the instructor (send me a detailed explanation using a private message on Piazza). If you miss few synchronous lectures (one or two) then you don't need to do this.

                  We will offer asynchronous options that need to be completed in a timely manner. 
                  For these students, we will have a different way of counting participation:

                  <li>You will be asked to participate in asynchronous team discussions using Piazza.</li>
                  <li>If asked to, you will be required to attend office hours.</li>
                  <li>You might be asked to complete oral interviews where you explain concepts or code, or do live coding. </li>
                  <li>You might be asked to submit video recordings where you explain a concept, explain your code, or present a diagram. </li>

                  Just as you can do a google search for code online, it is trivial for us to do the same. We have caught numerous people cheating in the past in this way. If you feel pressured about an assignment, please come see me instead of cheating.
