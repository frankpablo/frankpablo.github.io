                  </li>
                  <li>Analyze software routines to determine if the physical limitations of the device affect code design. If necessary, rewrite software routines that will operate correctly within the device’s physical limitation constraints. </li>
                  <li>Write software and configure hardware that accounts for the noisy real-world environment. Examples include debouncing keystrokes and smoothing analog signals to account for spikes.</li>
                  <li>Design cyber-physical systems that are optimized for speed, computational power, reliability and energy conservation. The cyber-physical systems are composed of software and hardware components that utilize multiple data inputs and outputs.</li>
                  <li>Correlate desired changes in the functioning of an embedded system to the different parts involved in its construction (hardware, control software, inputs/outputs, memory, communications, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Demonstrate familiarity with key concepts in circuit design, digital logic, memory management, and the basics of operating systems, networking, and security</li>
                  <li>Demonstrate familiarity with the underlying system through the different APIs and abstractions, including system support for process and thread control, virtual memory, and networking.</li>

                    Lectures will discuss the main concepts of systems programming and will be divided into theoretical and practical sessions which will include significant portions of programming (in C). Everyone should have their computers set up and ready to code before every lecture.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Labs will help you jump into more significant programming projects. You will program during lab, and be responsible for deliverables.

                    Students are assessed through a combination of individual and group homework, online exercises, lab assignments, and exams. Attendance of both labs and lectures is mandatory (attendance during COVID-19 will be evaluated a bit differently, see <i>Grading</i>).

                  Throughout the class, students should focus on adhering to the following general tenets: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Try it! -- A common question is "will this work", or "what will happen in this case". The only reasonable answer is "try it and see!" Your system will not blow up if you program incorrectly, and it is <b>essential</b> to learn to harness trial and error as one of the most effective ways to learn programming.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Know your sources, and use them! -- We will provide links and readings throughout the course and we will expect you to complete them in a timely manner.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be proud of your code! -- Properly indent it, simplify it where you can to make it more understandable, and comment it where appropriate. You're taking part in an art that most often is shared, and it matters if others can understand your code!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Planning is the best debugging! -- You should never jump into code before thinking about it thoroughly. Design your programs by breaking them into independently implementable chunks, and write + debug them one by one.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Practice methodical debugging! -- Spend time "stepping though" your program, statement by statement to understand the logic behind it, and why it is ending up in a buggy state. Do not take a program that doesn't work, and modify smaller parts of it until it works. Understand why it doesn't work, and use that knowledge to change or even rewrite your program!

                  Submitting 1 second late is the same as a full day late. Plan ahead and submit early.

                  <b>Prep Activities</b>: Prep activities are readings and exercises that must be completed in TinkerCad or ZyBooks BEFORE the Lectures or Labs. These will be graded in the following way:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Reading Only: 100 IF completed the reading on time; 0 otherwise.</li>
                    <li>Reading And Exercises: 30% is the exercise grade and 70% is for simply completing the reading; 0 otherwise.</li>
                    <li>Once the deadline arrives, these will be Read-Only with no extensions.</li>

                  COVID-19 has caused several changes to how we run the class.

                  In lieu of attendance, we will be keeping track of in-class and in-lab (synchronous) participation <b>or</b> your participation using asynchronous methods (Piazza, Office-Hours, Codio exercises).

                  During COVID-19, some students might not be able to attend synchronously because of their timezone or their available technology.

                <p class="px-5">
                  If you will not be able to attend (any) lectures and/or labs, you need to register as a fully-asynchronous student with the instructor (send me a detailed explanation using a private message on Piazza). If you miss few synchronous lectures (one or two) then you don't need to do this.

                  We will offer asynchronous options that need to be completed in a timely manner. 
                  For these students, we will have a different way of counting participation:

                  <li>If asked to, you will be required to attend office hours.</li>
                  <li>You might be asked to complete oral interviews where you explain concepts or code, or do live coding. </li>
                  <li>You might be asked to submit video recordings where you explain a concept, explain your code, or present a diagram. </li>

                  Just as you can do a google search for code online, it is trivial for us to do the same. We have caught numerous people cheating in the past in this way. If you feel pressured about an assignment, please come see me instead of cheating.
